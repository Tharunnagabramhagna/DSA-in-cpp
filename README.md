# 🚀 Data Structures & Algorithms in C++

Welcome to my DSA journey repository! I am a first-year **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning student** at SRM University, AP. This repository serves as a living document of my technical growth, focusing on building a rigorous foundation in computational efficiency and memory management.

## 📌 Current Status: Mastering Recursion
I have successfully transitioned from **Iterative Logic** (Loops) to **Recursive Thinking**. My current focus is on the "leap of faith"—understanding how the call stack handles self-referential functions and breaking down complex problems into base cases and recursive steps.

## 📂 Repository Structure

### ✅ Phase 1: Foundations (Completed)
* **Basics of C++:** Input/Output optimization, pointers, and manual memory allocation.
* **Arrays:** Implementations of Searching (Linear/Binary), Sorting, and Two-Pointer techniques.
* **Strings:** Pattern matching, frequency arrays, and character-based manipulation.
* **General Concepts:** Fundamental logic and modular code for basic DSA problems.

### 🔄 Phase 2: Recursion & Backtracking (In Progress)
* [x] **Functional Recursion:** Factorials, Fibonacci, and Array reversal.
* [ ] **Parameterized Recursion:** Passing calculations through the stack.
* [ ] **Multiple Recursion Calls:** Visualizing and drawing Recursion Trees.
* [ ] **Backtracking:** Starting with N-Queens and Sudoku solvers.



### ⏳ Phase 3: Advanced Data Structures (Upcoming)
* Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues.
* Trees and Graphs (The backbone of Neural Networks).
* Dynamic Programming (Optimizing recursion with Memoization).

## 🧠 Algorithmic Philosophy
As an aspiring **ML Researcher**, I don't just solve for "Accepted" results. I focus on:
1.  **Time Complexity ($O(n)$):** Minimizing execution cycles and optimizing bottlenecks.
2.  **Space Complexity ($S(n)$):** Deep understanding of the **Auxiliary Space** used by the recursive call stack.
3.  **Clean Code:** Writing well-documented, readable C++ for future collaborations.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Language:** C++17 / C++20
* **Environment:** VS Code / GCC Compiler
* **Focus:** Leveraging DSA for **Extreme Classification** and **AI Optimization**.
